            <h2>Blog Bio:</h2>
            <p>I made this blog as a way for me to put my thoughts into words. My hope is that I can articulate things in a more coherent manner as I practice writing more blogs. Those who take an interest in me will appreciate the writing that I put here, as I know that not everyone will go out of there way to find my blog. I appreciate everyone that takes the time to read my snippets, and I truly hope that this becomes more than a memory dump of my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Cheers to my writing!</p>
